# map_view_app

The difficulty of building this app for me is to use the ArcGIS API, it is wrapped and difficult to find examples to do the functionalities desired.
The instructions of the app is in the question box on the map page:

click anywhere in Texas, hover over and clicking gives information about Well Depth on the map.
